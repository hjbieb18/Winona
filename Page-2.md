### Personal Review 


##### 1. Lake Park

        In my own personal opinion, Lake Park is a place I would reccomend for college students. Although,
        during the winter it is not ideal. Lake Park is known for its beach and has a decent trail to
        either rollerblade, take an evening stroll, or walk your dog. Aside from these basic activities,
        Lake Park gives public access to take kyaks or even rent a kyak. A popular scence activity at 
        Lake Park is frisbee.
