# Natural Sites of Winona


### Personal Review 


##### 1. Lake Park

        In my own personal opinion, Lake Park is a place I would reccomend for college students. Although,
        during the winter it is not ideal. Lake Park is known for its beach and has a decent trail to
        either rollerblade, take an evening stroll, or walk your dog. Aside from these basic activities,
        Lake Park gives public access to take kyaks or even rent a kyak. A popular scence activity at 
        Lake Park is frisbee.

##### 2. Great River Bluffs State Park 
        
        I have been to this side of the Winona Bluffs once. Here I was able to along the trail of the Great River
        Bluffs, at this time last year it was pretty breathe taking. When I visited,it was flooding/mud season.
        The vantage point gave you true perspective of what was taking place. It was something to experience and
        something to do in Winona, worth while.
