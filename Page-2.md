# Natural Sites of Winona


### Personal Review 


##### 1. Lake Park

        In my own personal opinion, Lake Park is a place I would reccomend for college students. Although,
        during the winter it is not ideal. Lake Park is known for its beach and has a decent trail to
        either rollerblade, take an evening stroll, or walk your dog. Aside from these basic activities,
        Lake Park gives public access to take kyaks or even rent a kyak. A popular scence activity at 
        Lake Park is frisbee.

##### 2. Great River Bluffs State Park 
        
        I have been to this side of the Winona Bluffs once. Here I was able to along the trail of the Great River
        Bluffs, at this time last year it was pretty breathe taking. When I visited,it was flooding/mud
        season.The vantage point gave you true perspective of what was taking place. It was something
        to experience and something to do in Winona, worth while.

##### 3. Sugar Loaf
        
        
        This is probobly the most iconic site to see in Winona and is suggested by anyone who's seen the
        "Rock". I reccomend this site strictly because of this reason. In comparison to the Great River
        Bluffs State Park, the trails are not to extreme. But, it too, has a great vantage point of Winona.
        I really like this trail and suggest it to first-timers of Winona, mostly because it is closer to
        the main drag.
