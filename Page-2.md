# Natural Sites of Winona


### Personal Review 


##### 1. Lake Park
> *In my own personal opinion*, **Lake Park** is a place I would reccomend for college students. Although, during the winter it is not ideal. **Lake Park** is known for its beach and has a decent trail to either rollerblade, take an evening stroll, or walk your dog. Aside from these basic activities, **Lake Park** gives *public access* to your own kyaks or even rent a kyak. A *popular* activity to do at **Lake Park** is *frisbee*, from what I have seen and *experienced*.

##### 2. Great River Bluffs State Park 
 > I have been to this side of the **Winona Bluffs** *once*. Here, I was able to go along the trail of the **Great River Bluffs**, at this time last year it was pretty *breathe taking*. When I visited, it was flooding/mud season. The *vantage point* gave you **true** perspective of what was taking place. It was something to *experience* and something to do in **Winona**, worth while.

##### 3. Sugar Loaf
> This is probobly the most *iconic site* to see in **Winona** and is highly suggested by anyone who's seen the **"Rock"**. I reccomend this site *strictly* because of this reason. In comparison to the **Great River Bluffs State Park**, it's trails are not to extreme. But, it too, people can **rock climb** up where it has a great *vantage* point of **Winona**. I really like this trail and suggest it to first-timers of **Winona**, mostly because it is closer to the main drag.
